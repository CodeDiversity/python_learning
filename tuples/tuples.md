## Tuples

Note: Tuples are immutable, meaning they can't be changed. 

alphabet = ('a','b','c','d')

Why use a tuple ? 

They are faster than lists, lighter in weight. Make code safer from bugs and problems showing up since it can't be changed. 

locations = {
    (35.6895, 39.6917) : "Tokyo Office"
}

they can be used as keys in dictionary.
